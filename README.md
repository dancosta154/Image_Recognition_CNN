# Capstone: Image Recognition with Neural Networks

#### Project Status: [Incomplete]

## Project Outline (Pre-Work)

**Paint the recent wildfire picture in US:**

1990 - current (quick-high level)
- Number of Fires burned by year - nationally
- Acres burned by year - nationally

2021 (quick-high level most recent year)
- Wildfires by State (2021) -- num fires & acres burned -- *Already have this*
- Top 10 States for Wildfires Ranked by Number of Acres Burned (2021) (scale based on state size) -- *Already have this*
- *Also have it by number of fires -- but don't care as much about this I don't think.. could join df's if needed*

**Minimize Focus to CA based on previous graph** (little more time spent here, driving home these points as very concerning)
- Count of Largest Fires in this time period vs all time -- *Already have this*
- Count of Most Destructive Fires in this time period vs all time -- *Already have this*
- Count of Costliest wildfires in this time period vs all time -- *Already have this*
- Count of Deadliest wildfires in this time period vs all time -- *Already have this*

... this is a good way to tell the "How Fires are Exploding in the last 30 years" story...

**Next:**

Collect data for how important it is to identify / respond quickly to new start

Talk about challenge in "confirming" a fire (a confirmed fire is anything >= 0.1 acres) -- often times it's crowd-sourced information... i.e. "Saw a bunch of smoke while hiking over by x trailhead" or "There may be smoke in the distance somewhere in the Arapahoe National Forest"

**Capstone Intro**

That will lead nicely into Capstone project of building a model to identify Smoke Columns via imagery
